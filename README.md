**Prerequisites**

1. Microsoft Visual C++ compiler (MSVC) >= 14.34, included with
   - [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022)
   - [Visual Studio 2022 with a C++ workload](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vscpp-step-0-installation?view=msvc-170)

## TODO
- [ ] Generate `src\dotnet\Directory.Build.props` via the build script's generate target.

   Right now the path to the built libraries are hard-coded but they're decided by the build so this file should be generated.
